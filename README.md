# Micro-Service Example Project

A **micro-service architecture** example with multiple services, integrated **Redis**, **Kafka**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**, with a **Next.js + Tailwind CSS frontend**, fully containerized with **Docker**. Includes testing with **JUnit + Mockito**, code coverage via **JaCoCo**, and static code analysis using **PMD**.

## Architecture

The project follows a **micro-service architecture** with separate services:

* **User Service** – Handles user-related operations.
* **Order Service** – Handles order processing and events.
* **API Gateway** – Routes requests between frontend and services.
* **Discovery Server** – Enables service registration and discovery.
* **Frontend** – Built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS, communicates with API Gateway.

**Integrations**:

* **Redis** – Caching layer for fast data access.
* **Kafka** – Event streaming between services.
* **Prometheus** – Metrics collection.
* **Grafana** – Visualization of metrics and monitoring dashboards.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Java + Spring Boot
* **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
* **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL (can configure in `init.sql`)
* **Messaging**: Kafka
* **Cache**: Redis
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
* **Testing**: JUnit + Mockito
* **Code Quality**: PMD, JaCoCo

## Features

* Fully containerized micro-services for easy deployment
* Event-driven architecture with Kafka
* Distributed caching with Redis
* Metrics and monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
* Frontend integrated with API Gateway
* Unit and integration testing with coverage reports
* Static code analysis for maintainability

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* Java 17+
* Node.js 18+
* Git

---

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunarcd/micro-service.git
cd micro-service
```

---

### Running services locally

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

* Access **frontend**: `http://localhost:3003`
* Access **Grafana**: `http://localhost:3000`
* Access **Prometheus**: `http://localhost:9090`

---

## Testing

Run **unit tests** for all services:

```bash
# For backend services
./mvnw test
```

* **Coverage reports** generated by JaCoCo (check `target/site/jacoco/index.html`)
* **Mockito** used for mocking dependencies in tests

---

## Code Quality

Run **PMD** static analysis:

```bash
./mvnw pmd:pmd
```

* Report location: `target/site/pmd.html`
* Helps identify common code issues and enforce coding standards

---

## Docker Setup

* Each micro-service has its own **Dockerfile**
* Docker Compose orchestrates the multi-container environment
* Services communicate internally via Docker network

---

## Frontend

* Built with **Next.js** + **Tailwind CSS**
* Connects to API Gateway for backend communication
* Supports modern frontend features (SSR, API routes)
* Includes reusable components and hooks for API calls

---

## Monitoring

* **Prometheus** collects metrics from each service
* **Grafana dashboards** visualize service health, events, and performance
* Fully integrated with Docker Compose for local testing

---
